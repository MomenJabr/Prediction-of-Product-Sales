# 📦 Prediction of Product Sales

This repository contains a Colab Notebook that performs **exploratory data analysis and machine learning modeling** for predicting product sales based on historical sales data.

The goal of this project is to analyze key features in the dataset and build predictive models that estimate future product sales. The notebook walks through data cleaning, visualization, model training, and evaluation.

## 🧾 Project Overview

Predicting product sales helps businesses make strategic decisions about **inventory forecasting, resource allocation, and marketing planning**. In this project, we:

- Load and explore a historical sales dataset  
- Visualize patterns and distributions of key variables  
- Calculate summary statistics like **mean** and **median**  


This type of analysis is fundamental in retail forecasting and supply chain optimization.

## 📂 Dataset

The notebook uses a dataset that includes both numerical and categorical variables related to product attributes and sales. Typical columns may include:

- `Item_Weight`  
- `Item_Outlet_Sales`  
- Other product metadata

Make sure your dataset is in the same directory as the notebook or update the file path accordingly.

## 📈 Key Steps (Notebook Workflow)

1. **Import Libraries**  
   Load all required packages for data handling and visualization.

2. **Load Data**  
   Read the CSV file into a DataFrame.

3. **Data Cleaning**  
   Handle missing values, correct data types, and prepare features.

4. **Data Visualization**  
   Create histograms, box plots, and summary statistics to understand data distributions.
